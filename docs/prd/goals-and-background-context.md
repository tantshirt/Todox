# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Ship an MVP TODO app that satisfies all required stories and rubric points by October 13, 2025
- Build a modular, testable, and maintainable full-stack application with clean architecture
- Demonstrate proficiency with modern web development practices including Git hygiene and daily commits
- Provide smooth deployment paths on Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend)
- Enable users to register, authenticate, and manage personal task lists with priority and deadline tracking
- Support task organization through a flexible labeling system
- Achieve production-ready code quality with E2E testing coverage

## Background Context

This TODO application addresses the need for a personal task management system that demonstrates full-stack development proficiency with modern technologies. The project serves dual purposes: providing a functional task management tool for end users while showcasing technical capabilities across authentication, CRUD operations, database integration, and cloud deployment.

The current landscape shows demand for lightweight, accessible task managers that prioritize core functionality over feature bloat. This MVP focuses on essential task management capabilities—user authentication, task CRUD with priority/deadline fields, and label-based organization—while maintaining clean code architecture and comprehensive test coverage that positions the application for future enhancement.
