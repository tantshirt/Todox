# Story 3.3: Frontend Label Management

## Status
Ready

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to create and manage my labels through the UI,  
**so that** I can set up custom categories for my tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Labels page created at `/labels` showing list of all user labels
2. Page requires authentication and fetches labels from `GET /labels` API
3. "Create Label" button opens form/modal with name input field
4. Label creation form calls `POST /labels` and adds new label to list on success
5. Each label in list has Edit and Delete action buttons
6. Edit button opens form pre-filled with current label name, submission calls `PATCH /labels/:id`
7. Delete button shows confirmation dialog, confirmed deletion calls `DELETE /labels/:id`
8. Empty state displays helpful message when no labels exist
9. Form validation ensures label name is required
10. Duplicate name errors display clear message
11. All actions provide loading states and success/error feedback via toasts
