# Epic 4: Enhanced Features

## Epic Goal

Enhance the Todox application with advanced features that improve user productivity: task filtering by labels, task search functionality, due date notifications, and task import/export capabilities.

## Epic Description

This epic adds power-user features that make Todox more versatile and productive for users managing many tasks. These features build on the solid foundation of Epics 1-3.

## User Stories

### Story 4.1: Task Filtering by Labels
**As a** user,  
**I want** to filter tasks by one or more labels,  
**so that** I can focus on specific categories of work.

**Value:** Enables users to quickly find related tasks without scrolling through entire list.

### Story 4.2: Task Search
**As a** user,  
**I want** to search tasks by title or description,  
**so that** I can quickly find specific tasks.

**Value:** Essential for users with many tasks to find items quickly.

### Story 4.3: Due Date Notifications
**As a** user,  
**I want** visual indicators for tasks approaching their deadline,  
**so that** I don't miss important due dates.

**Value:** Helps users prioritize work and avoid missing deadlines.

### Story 4.4: Task Export/Import
**As a** user,  
**I want** to export my tasks to JSON and import them back,  
**so that** I can backup my data or move between devices.

**Value:** Data portability and backup capabilities for user confidence.

## Dependencies

- Requires: Epic 1 (Authentication), Epic 2 (Tasks), Epic 3 (Labels)
- All stories in this epic can be implemented independently

## Acceptance Criteria for Epic

1. Users can filter task list by selecting one or more labels
2. Users can search tasks using a search bar
3. Tasks show visual warnings when deadline is approaching
4. Users can download all tasks as JSON file
5. Users can upload JSON file to import tasks

## Technical Considerations

- **Filtering:** Client-side filtering (data already loaded with React Query)
- **Search:** Client-side search for MVP (backend search can be added later)
- **Notifications:** Visual indicators only (no email/push for MVP)
- **Export/Import:** JSON format, client-side processing

## Priority

Priority 2 (Post-MVP enhancements)

## Estimated Effort

- Story 4.1: 2-3 hours (frontend only)
- Story 4.2: 1-2 hours (frontend only)
- Story 4.3: 1-2 hours (frontend only)
- Story 4.4: 2-3 hours (frontend + minimal backend)
- **Total:** 6-10 hours
