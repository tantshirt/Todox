## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

"As UX Expert, please review this PRD and create a comprehensive frontend architecture document. Focus on the UI Design Goals section and translate the core screens and interaction paradigms into detailed component specifications, user flows, and Shadcn UI implementation guidance. Consider accessibility requirements (WCAG AA), responsive design patterns, and the technical stack (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Shadcn, Tailwind). The frontend architecture should provide sufficient detail for the dev agent to implement all UI stories in Epic 1, 2, and 3."

### Architect Prompt

"As Architect, please review this PRD and create a comprehensive full-stack architecture document covering both backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend (Next.js, Shadcn). Address the technical assumptions, define the data models, API contracts, authentication flow, repository patterns, and testing strategy. Ensure the architecture supports the sequential implementation of Epic 1 (Foundation & Auth), Epic 2 (Task Management), and Epic 3 (Labels). Include file structure details, deployment configurations for Railway and Vercel, and integration guidance for all specified MCPs."
