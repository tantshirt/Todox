# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Todox application will provide a clean, intuitive interface for personal task management that prioritizes clarity and efficiency. Users should be able to quickly capture tasks, organize them with labels, and track priorities without unnecessary friction. The interface emphasizes immediate feedback, clear visual hierarchy, and graceful handling of edge cases like empty states and errors.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Form-based task creation:** Simple, focused forms with inline validation and clear CTAs
- **List-based task viewing:** Scannable task list with visual indicators for priority and status
- **Inline editing:** Quick updates to task properties without leaving the main view
- **Tag/label chips:** Visual representation of labels with easy assignment/removal
- **Modal confirmations:** Destructive actions (delete) require explicit confirmation
- **Toast notifications:** Non-intrusive feedback for successful operations and errors

## Core Screens and Views

- **Landing/Login Screen:** Entry point for authentication
- **Registration Screen:** New user account creation
- **Dashboard/Task List:** Primary view showing all user tasks with filtering and actions
- **Task Creation Form:** Dedicated interface for adding new tasks with all required fields
- **Task Detail/Edit View:** Focused view for viewing and editing individual tasks
- **Labels Management:** Interface for creating and managing custom labels
- **Empty States:** Helpful guidance when no tasks or labels exist

## Accessibility

**WCAG AA Compliance**
- Semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators on interactive components
- ARIA labels where appropriate

## Branding

Clean, modern design aesthetic using Shadcn UI components. The interface should feel professional yet approachable, with consistent spacing, typography, and color usage. Emphasis on readability and functional design over decorative elements.

## Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive**
- Primary target: Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive layouts that adapt to tablet and mobile viewports
- Mobile-first CSS approach for optimal mobile experience
