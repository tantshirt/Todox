# Story 2.6: Frontend Task List View

## Status
Ready

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to view all my tasks in a clean, organized list,  
**so that** I can see my todos at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard/Task List page created at `/tasks` showing all user tasks
2. Page requires authentication (redirect to login if not authenticated)
3. Tasks fetched from `GET /tasks` API and displayed in list format using Shadcn components
4. Each task card/row shows: title, priority (with visual indicator), deadline, status, and action buttons
5. Tasks are sorted newest first by default
6. Empty state component displays helpful message and "Create Task" CTA when no tasks exist
7. Loading state shows skeleton loaders or spinner during initial data fetch
8. API errors display toast notification with retry option
9. Page is responsive and renders properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

## Dev Notes

**[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Dashboard/Task List]**

Dashboard is the primary view with task cards in grid/list layout.

**[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]**

TaskCard example includes priority color mapping and accessibility.

**[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Service Example - useTasks hook]**

React Query handles caching and loading states automatically.
